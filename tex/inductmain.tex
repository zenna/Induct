\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Model-based reinforcement learning is a powerful method for acting in unknown environments, but most approaches require specific, limiting assumptions about the world model.
Probabilistic program induction promises flexible, universal learning from data.
We present a principled method for inducing and using adaptive generative models in reinforcement learning. 
The approach is to learn probabilistic models from experience and choose actions by sparse sampling.

\section{Introduction}
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a successful field of machine learning that has enjoyed much practical application, and is often the method of choice when acting in unknown or partially-unknown environments.
However, there are simple examples of problems that humans solve effortlessly but pose challenges for standard RL algorithms. Consider the finite-state automaton in Figure 1.
We made this agent with church and he learned everything.
Well done, agent.
