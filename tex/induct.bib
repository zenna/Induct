  publisher =	"Massachusetts Institute of Technology",
  year = 	"2009",
  abstract =	"I introduce a new set of natively probabilistic
		 computing abstractions, including probabilistic
		 generalizations of Boolean circuits, backtracking
		 search and pure Lisp. I show how these tools let one
		 compactly specify probabilistic generative models,
		 generalize and parallelize widely used sampling
		 algorithms like rejection sampling and Markov chain
		 Monte Carlo, and solve difficult Bayesian inference
		 problems. I first introduce Church, a probabilistic
		 programming language for describing probabilistic
		 generative processes that induce distributions, which
		 generalizes Lisp, a language for describing
		 deterministic procedures that induce functions. I
		 highlight the ways randomness meshes with the
		 reflectiveness of Lisp to support the representation of
		 structured, uncertain knowledge, including
		 nonparametric Bayesian models from the current
		 literature, programs for decision making under
		 uncertainty, and programs that learn very simple
		 programs from data. I then introduce systematic
		 stochastic search, a recursive algorithm for exact and
		 approximate sampling that generalizes a popular form of
		 backtracking search to the broader setting of
		 stochastic simulation and recovers widely used particle
		 filters as a special case. I use it to solve
		 probabilistic reasoning problems from statistical
		 physics, causal reasoning and stereo vision. Finally, I
		 introduce stochastic digital circuits that model the
		 probability algebra just as traditional Boolean
		 circuits model the Boolean algebra.; (cont.) I show how
		 these circuits can be used to build massively parallel,
		 fault-tolerant machines for sampling and allow one to
		 efficiently run Markov chain Monte Carlo methods on
		 models with hundreds of thousands of variables in real
		 time. I emphasize the ways in which these ideas fit
		 together into a coherent software and hardware stack
		 for natively probabilistic computing, organized around
		 distributions and samplers rather than deterministic
		 functions. I argue that by building uncertainty and
		 randomness into the foundations of our programming
		 languages and computing machines, we may arrive at ones
		 that are more powerful, flexible and efficient than
		 deterministic designs, and are in better alignment with
		 the needs of computational science, statistics and
		 artificial intelligence.",
